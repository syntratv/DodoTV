const setupFaqs = [
  {
    q: 'How do I receive my login details after purchasing a plan?',
    a: 'Everything is handled live over WhatsApp. Once you confirm your plan and complete payment, our support team sends your setup details directly in the chat, usually within minutes.',
  },
  {
    q: `Which IPTV player do you recommend for setup ${FOCUS_KEYWORD}?`,
    a: 'We recommend IPTV Smarter Pro for the fastest channel zapping, lowest RAM usage, and best 4K performance across Firestick, Smart TVs, Apple devices, and PC or Mac. It is our top pick for smooth playback.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need to activate IPTV Smarter Pro separately?',
    a: 'The activation service is included free with every subscription. Choose Auto Setup (send us your Device Key and we activate remotely) or Manual Setup (enter your M3U or Xtream Codes yourself).',
  },
  {
    q: `How long does setup ${FOCUS_KEYWORD} take?`,
    a: 'Most customers are streaming within 10 minutes. Installing IPTV Smarter Pro takes about 2 minutes, activation takes 1 to 2 minutes, and content loading takes 1 to 2 minutes.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I use my login credentials on multiple devices?',
    a: 'Yes. You can install the app on unlimited devices. The number of simultaneous streams depends on your plan, with 1 screen on the Starter, and 2 or 3 screens on the Multi-Room plans.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What should I do if I get a login error in IPTV Smarter Pro?',
    a: 'Confirm you selected the Xtream Codes API method (not M3U) and that there are no extra spaces in your username or password. If it persists, message us on WhatsApp and most issues resolve within 2 minutes.',
  },
  {
    q: `What internet speed do I need for 4K ${FOCUS_KEYWORD} streaming?`,
    a: 'For 4K Ultra HD we recommend 30 Mbps minimum. Full HD 1080p runs smoothly on 15 Mbps. Our anti-freeze server technology adapts to your connection speed automatically.',
  },
  {
    q: `Do I need a VPN to use ${FOCUS_KEYWORD}?`,
    a: 'No. Our global servers are optimized and secure. If your internet provider applies streaming throttling during peak hours, you can enable a VPN without issues.',
  },
];

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// LONG-FORM Q&A
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
const longFormFaqs = [
  {
    q: `What devices work best for setup ${FOCUS_KEYWORD}?`,
    a: `For the best ${FOCUS_KEYWORD} experience, we recommend Amazon Firestick 4K Max for streaming sticks, Samsung Tizen or LG webOS Smart TVs for built-in apps, Apple TV 4K for the AirPlay ecosystem, and any Windows 11 or macOS Sonoma desktop for full 4K playback. All of these devices support IPTV Smarter Pro, our recommended IPTV player, and handle 4K and 60FPS content without frame drops. Older devices like Firestick Lite or second-generation Apple TV still work but cap out at Full HD. For the smoothest 4K performance, choose hardware from the last two generations.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'How does remote activation actually work?',
    a: `Remote activation is the easiest setup ${FOCUS_KEYWORD} method. After you contact us on WhatsApp and complete payment, our support team asks for your device identifier. For IPTV Smarter Pro this is a Device Key or MAC address shown on the app welcome screen. We register that key on our server, link it to your subscription, and within 60 seconds your channel list loads automatically the moment you reopen the app. No typing, no manual credentials, no risk of errors. If you prefer to handle it yourself, we also send the standard M3U URL and Xtream Codes credentials. Both methods produce identical 4K streaming performance.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'What if I have an older Smart TV that cannot install IPTV Smarter Pro?',
    a: `If your Smart TV is more than 5 years old and cannot install IPTV Smarter Pro directly, you still have options. The most popular solution is an Amazon Firestick 4K Max. It plugs into any HDMI port and turns older TVs into full 4K ${FOCUS_KEYWORD} streamers in under 5 minutes. Alternatively, an Android TV box, Nvidia Shield, or Apple TV 4K delivers the same result. Our WhatsApp support team regularly helps customers upgrade older televisions with a low-cost streaming stick. Message us and we will recommend the best device for your specific TV model and viewing habits.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I switch devices later or move my subscription?',
    a: `Yes, absolutely. Your ${FOCUS_KEYWORD} subscription is tied to your account, not to a single device. If you upgrade from a Firestick to an Apple TV, add a second Smart TV, or move your setup to a new PC, simply contact our WhatsApp support team and we will re-activate the subscription on your new device, usually within 2 minutes. Device changes are unlimited and free for the entire duration of your subscription. If you need simultaneous streaming in multiple rooms, we offer 2-screen and 3-screen plans so your household can watch different content at the same time without interruption.`,
